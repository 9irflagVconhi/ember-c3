# How to Enable Realview Graphics in Solidworks 2015 19 Without a Certified Graphics Card
  
If you are using Solidworks 2015 19 and want to enjoy the realistic rendering effects of Realview Graphics, but you don't have a certified graphics card, you might think that you are out of luck. However, there is a simple hack that can enable Realview Graphics on any graphics card, even if it is not officially supported by Solidworks. In this article, we will show you how to do it in a few easy steps.
  
## What is Realview Graphics and Why Do You Need It?
  
Realview Graphics is a feature of Solidworks that enhances the appearance of your 3D models by adding realistic lighting, shadows, reflections, and textures. It can make your designs look more professional and impressive, especially when you present them to clients or stakeholders. Realview Graphics can also help you visualize how your products will look in real life, which can improve your design decisions and reduce errors.

However, Realview Graphics requires a certified graphics card to work properly. A certified graphics card is one that has been tested and approved by Solidworks to ensure compatibility and performance. You can find a list of certified graphics cards on the Solidworks website. If you have a non-certified graphics card, Realview Graphics will be disabled by default, and you will only see the standard shading mode.
  
## How to Hack Realview Graphics in Solidworks 2015 19
  
Fortunately, there is a way to bypass the certification check and enable Realview Graphics on any graphics card. This hack involves modifying a registry key that controls the Realview Graphics setting in Solidworks. Before you proceed, make sure you backup your registry and create a restore point in case something goes wrong. Here are the steps to follow:
  
1. Close Solidworks if it is running.
2. Open the Windows Registry Editor by typing `regedit` in the Start menu or Run dialog box.
3. Navigate to the following key: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SolidWorks\SOLIDWORKS 2015\Performance\Graphics\Hardware\Current`
4. Double-click on the `Renderer` value and copy its data to a text file or clipboard.
5. Open the text file or clipboard and replace the last four digits of the data with `08b0`. For example, if the original data was `PCI\VEN_10DE&DEV_0DFC&SUBSYS_1619103C&REV_A1`, the modified data should be `PCI\VEN_10DE&DEV_0DFC&SUBSYS_1619103C&REV_08b0`.
6. Paste the modified data back into the `Renderer` value and click OK.
7. Close the Registry Editor and restart Solidworks.
8. In Solidworks, go to Tools > Options > Performance and check the box for `Use software OpenGL`.
9. In Solidworks, go to View > Display and enable `RealView Graphics`.

Congratulations! You have successfully hacked Realview Graphics in Solidworks 2015 19. You should now see your 3D models with enhanced realism and quality. Enjoy!
