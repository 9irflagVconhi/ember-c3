A ROM is a file that contains a copy of a game that can be played on an emulator. An emulator is a software that mimics the functions of a console, such as the Nintendo DS, and allows you to play games on your PC, Android, or iPhone. However, some ROMs may not be fully translated or compatible with your emulator, so you will need a patch to fix these issues.
