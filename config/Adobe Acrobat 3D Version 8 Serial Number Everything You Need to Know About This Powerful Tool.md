Kya Kehna was one of the first Bollywood films to deal with the issue of premarital pregnancy and single motherhood. The film was praised for its bold and progressive message and for its portrayal of a strong female protagonist who defies social norms and stands up for her rights. The film also highlighted the importance of family support and acceptance in such situations.
 
The film received mixed reviews from critics, who appreciated the performances of the lead actors, especially Preity Zinta, who made her debut with this film. Zinta was lauded for her natural and convincing act as Priya, a girl who goes through various emotions and struggles after becoming pregnant. She won several awards and nominations for her role, including the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut. Saif Ali Khan and Chandrachur Singh also received praise for their roles as Rahul and Ajay, respectively. The film's music by Rajesh Roshan was also well-received, with songs like "Dekhiye Aji Jaaneman", "Kya Kehna" and "O Soniye Dil Jaaniye" becoming popular.
 
However, some critics also pointed out the flaws and drawbacks of the film, such as its poor execution, outdated style, melodramatic tone and unrealistic depiction of some characters and situations. Some critics also felt that the film was too preachy and moralistic and did not explore the complexities and nuances of the issue. Some critics also noted that the film was influenced by Hollywood films like Kramer vs. Kramer (1979) and Notting Hill (1999).
 
Despite the mixed reviews, Kya Kehna was a commercial success at the box office, earning over Rs. 28 crore worldwide. It was one of the highest-grossing films of 2000 and established Preity Zinta as a leading actress in Bollywood. The film also gained a cult following over the years and is considered as one of the most memorable films of Preity Zinta's career.
