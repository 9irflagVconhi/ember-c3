Have you ever encountered a situation where you need to extract the original (x,y) data from a graph or a plot, but you don't have access to the source file or the data values? If so, you might find Portable GetData Graph Digitizer 2.24 useful. This is a program that allows you to digitize graphs and plots by placing points over the image and getting the corresponding coordinates. You can then copy the data to the clipboard, or export it to various formats such as TXT, XLS, XML, DXF or EPS.

Portable GetData Graph Digitizer 2.24 is a portable app that does not require installation. You can make as many copies as you need and carry it in a flash drive. You can use it on any computer, even without administrator access. It does not change any settings on the host computer, nor does it conflict with other applications.
 
The program has a simple and intuitive interface that guides you through the four steps of digitizing: 1) open a graph, 2) set the scale (coordinate system), 3) digitize (automatically or manually), and 4) copy or export data. You can also adjust various settings such as color, transparency, point size, smoothing, etc. The program supports various image formats such as BMP, JPG, TIF, GIF, PNG and PCX.
 
Portable GetData Graph Digitizer 2.24 is a handy tool for researchers, students, engineers and anyone who needs to work with graphs and plots. It can save you time and effort by allowing you to get the data you need from scanned or printed images.

Here are some more paragraphs about Portable GetData Graph Digitizer 2.24:
 
One of the advantages of this program is that it can digitize both linear and logarithmic graphs. You can also choose between Cartesian, polar, ternary and date/time coordinate systems. The program can automatically detect and trace the curves on the graph, or you can manually place the points by clicking on the image. You can also zoom in and out, pan and rotate the image for better accuracy.
 
Another feature of this program is that it can handle multiple graphs in a single image. You can select different regions of the image and assign different scales and coordinate systems to each one. You can also label the axes and the curves, and add legends and titles to the graph. The program can also calculate some basic statistics such as mean, standard deviation, slope and intercept for each curve.
