The book also covers three major areas of applications of bioinformatics: genomics, proteomics and drug discovery. These areas are closely related and have a huge impact on biomedical research and human health.
 
Genomics is the study of the structure, function and evolution of genomes, which are the complete sets of genetic information in an organism. Genomics can reveal the genetic variations that underlie diseases, traits and responses to drugs. Genomics can also help identify novel genes and pathways that can be potential targets for drug development[^1^] [^4^].

Proteomics is the study of the structure, function and interactions of proteins, which are the main molecules that carry out biological processes. Proteomics can provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of diseases and drug actions, as well as identify biomarkers that can be used for diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of treatment outcomes. Proteomics can also help discover new protein targets and modulators for drug design[^2^] [^5^].
 
Drug discovery is the process of finding new compounds that can modulate a biological target or pathway to achieve a therapeutic effect. Drug discovery involves several steps, such as target identification and validation, hit identification and optimization, lead optimization and preclinical testing. Bioinformatics methods and tools can facilitate and accelerate drug discovery by providing computational approaches for screening, designing, predicting and evaluating potential drug candidates[^3^] .
