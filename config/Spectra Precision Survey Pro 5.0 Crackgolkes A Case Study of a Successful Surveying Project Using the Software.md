- Active DXF background maps: This feature allows users to import a DXF file as a background map and select objects from it for stakeout, COGO calculations, point creation, etc. The DXF layers can be controlled for visibility and usage, and the objects are drawn in color.
- New data management control: This feature provides a single, intelligent, flexible file format that enables users to edit survey data to correct entry errors and update coordinates instantly. The file viewer/editor also allows users to view and manage their data in different ways.
- Graphical and workflow enhancements: This feature includes a user-customizable Home screen that enables users to access their most commonly used workflows directly. It also includes an active survey map that allows users to control surveys interactively from the map views, such as staking a point by tapping on it, initiating measurements to store points, inversing to a line by tapping on it, etc.
- Updated feature code support: This feature supports high-precision GIS data collection with auto line-work commands and real-time line drawing. The lines can be edited or used for other options such as stakeout or COGO. The FXL file format is supported for import and export between other FXL-enabled applications such as Spectra Precision Survey Office software.
- Support for new Spectra Precision GNSS receivers: This feature supports the ProMark 800 and ProMark 200 GNSS receivers that offer high-performance positioning solutions for surveying applications.
