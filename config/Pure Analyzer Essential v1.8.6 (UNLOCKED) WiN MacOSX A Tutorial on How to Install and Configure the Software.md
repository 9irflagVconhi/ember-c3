First, you need to install Pure Analyzer Essential v1.8.6 (UNLOCKED) WiN MacOSX on your computer and launch it. You will see the main window with a blank display area and a toolbar at the top. To load an audio file, click on the File menu and select Open Audio File. Then, browse to the location of your audio file and click Open.
 
You will see a waveform of your audio file in the display area, along with some basic information such as sample rate, bit depth, duration, and channels. You can zoom in and out of the waveform by using the mouse wheel or the + and - buttons on the toolbar. You can also drag the waveform left and right to scroll through it.
 
To start the analysis, click on the Play button on the toolbar or press the spacebar on your keyboard. You will see a green cursor moving along the waveform and a red line indicating the current position. You will also hear the audio playing through your speakers or headphones.
 
Now, you can switch between different display modes by clicking on the buttons on the left side of the toolbar. Each display mode shows you a different aspect of your audio signal. For example, if you click on the Spectrum button, you will see a frequency spectrum of your audio signal, showing you how much energy is present at each frequency band. You can adjust the resolution and range of the spectrum by using the sliders at the bottom of the display area.
 
If you click on the Phase button, you will see a vector scope and a goniometer of your audio signal, showing you how well your stereo channels are balanced and aligned. You can adjust the zoom and rotation of the vector scope by using the sliders at the bottom of the display area.
 
If you click on the Level button, you will see a peak and RMS level meter of your audio signal, showing you how loud your audio is and how much headroom you have. You can also see the integrated loudness value and the loudness range value according to the EBU R128 / ITU-R BS 1770 standards. You can adjust the scale and reference level of the meter by using the sliders at the bottom of the display area.
 
If you click on the Response button, you will see a frequency response curve of your audio signal, showing you how flat or uneven your audio is across the frequency spectrum. You can also see a pink noise reference curve for comparison. You can adjust the smoothing and compensation of the curve by using the sliders at the bottom of the display area.
 
As you can see, Pure Analyzer Essential v1.8.6 (UNLOCKED) WiN MacOSX gives you a lot of information about your audio signal in real-time and in high resolution.
