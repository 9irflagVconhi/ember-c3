Mods are modifications made by fans that alter or improve the original game in some way. There are many types of mods for Dragon Ball Xenoverse, such as animations, characters, cheats, graphics, GUI, music, quests, skills and more. One of the most popular categories of mods is CAC mods, which are specifically designed for custom characters.
 
CAC mods can give players more options and freedom to customize their CACs, such as changing their appearance, voice, moveset, stats and transformations. Some CAC mods also add new races, costumes, accessories and hairstyles that are not available in the base game. For example, players can create a CAC that looks like Goku Black, Broly, Android 21 or even Sonic the Hedgehog.

To install and use Dragon Ball Xenoverse CAC mods, players need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download and install a mod manager tool such as XV2Patcher or XV2ModInstaller. These tools allow players to easily manage their mods and avoid conflicts or errors.
2. Download the CAC mods that they want to use from reliable sources such as Video Game Mods[^1^] [^2^] or Xenoverse Mods[^3^]. These websites have a large collection of CAC mods for both Xenoverse 1 and 2.
3. Extract the mod files and copy them to the appropriate folder in the game directory. For example, if the mod is a skill mod, copy it to the "skills" folder. If the mod is a character mod, copy it to the "chara" folder.
4. Launch the game using the mod manager tool and enjoy the new features and options for their CACs.

Note: Some CAC mods may require additional steps or tools to work properly. Players should always read the instructions and requirements of each mod before installing it. They should also backup their game files and save data before using any mods.

Using Dragon Ball Xenoverse CAC mods can have many benefits for players who want to enjoy the game in new and creative ways. Some of the benefits are:

- Players can create their own unique and original CACs that reflect their personality, preferences and style. They can mix and match different elements from various Dragon Ball characters or other franchises to make their CACs stand out.
- Players can access more content and features that are not available in the base game or the official DLCs. They can use new skills, items, transformations, costumes and more that add more variety and fun to the gameplay.
- Players can challenge themselves and test their skills by using CAC mods that make the game more difficult or realistic. For example, they can use mods that increase the enemy AI, reduce the damage output or limit the healing items.
- Players can support and appreciate the work of talented and passionate modders who create and share their CAC mods with the community. They can also give feedback and suggestions to help improve the quality and compatibility of the mods.

However, using Dragon Ball Xenoverse CAC mods also has some drawbacks and risks that players should be aware of. Some of the drawbacks are:

- Players may encounter bugs, glitches, crashes or errors when using CAC mods that are incompatible with each other or with the game version. They may also lose their progress or corrupt their save data if they use mods that alter the game files.
- Players may face legal issues or penalties if they use CAC mods that violate the terms of service or the intellectual property rights of the game developers or other parties. They may also get banned or suspended from online services or multiplayer modes if they use mods that give them an unfair advantage or disrupt the game balance.
- Players may lose interest or satisfaction in playing the base game or the official DLCs if they use CAC mods that make them too powerful or too easy. They may also miss out on some of the original features or content that the game developers intended for them to experience.
- Players may have difficulties finding or installing CAC mods that suit their needs or preferences. They may also have troubles updating or uninstalling CAC mods that are outdated or unwanted.

Therefore, players should use Dragon Ball Xenoverse CAC mods with caution and moderation. They should always backup their game files and save data before using any mods. They should also respect the rules and regulations of the game developers and other parties involved. They should also balance their use of CAC mods with playing the base game or the official DLCs to enjoy the game fully.
