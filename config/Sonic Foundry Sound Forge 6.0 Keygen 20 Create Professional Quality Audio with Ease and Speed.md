In this article, we will take a closer look at some of the features and functions of Sound Forge 6.0 and how to use them effectively.
 
## Recording Audio
 
Sound Forge 6.0 allows you to record audio from any source connected to your sound card, such as a microphone, a line-in device, or a CD player. You can also record audio from other applications using the Loopback feature. To start recording, you need to select the Record button on the toolbar or press Ctrl+R. A dialog box will appear where you can choose the input source, the sample rate, the bit depth, the channels, and the file name. You can also adjust the input level and monitor the input signal with a VU meter. Once you are ready, click OK and Sound Forge 6.0 will start recording.
 
You can pause or resume recording by pressing the spacebar or clicking the Pause button on the toolbar. You can also stop recording by pressing Esc or clicking the Stop button on the toolbar. When you stop recording, Sound Forge 6.0 will save the recorded file and open it in a new window. You can then edit, process, or save the file as you wish.
 
## Editing Audio
 
Sound Forge 6.0 offers many tools and commands for editing audio files. You can select any part of the audio waveform by clicking and dragging with the mouse or using keyboard shortcuts. You can then cut, copy, paste, delete, trim, crop, fade, normalize, reverse, or invert the selected audio. You can also use the Undo and Redo buttons on the toolbar or press Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Y to undo or redo your edits.
 
One of the most powerful features of Sound Forge 6.0 is non-destructive editing. This means that your edits are not applied directly to the original file, but rather stored in a temporary file that references the original file. This way, you can make as many edits as you want without affecting the quality or size of the original file. You can also switch between different edits using the History window or press Ctrl+H. To apply your edits permanently to the original file, you need to save it with a new name or overwrite it.
