## How to Optimize Your Meta Tags for SEO
 
Meta tags are snippets of code that tell search engines what your article is about. They are not visible to your readers, but they can affect how your article ranks in the search results. There are two main types of meta tags that you should optimize for SEO: the title tag and the meta description.
 
The title tag is the headline that appears in the search results. It should include your main keyword and a compelling reason for people to click on your article. The meta description is the summary that appears below the title. It should provide more details about your article and include a call to action.
