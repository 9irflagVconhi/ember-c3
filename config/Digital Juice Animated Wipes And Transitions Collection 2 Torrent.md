## What are Digital Juice Animated Wipes and Transitions?
  
Digital Juice Animated Wipes and Transitions are ready-to-use Quicktime files that come in HD and SD formats. They can be dragged and dropped into any video or animation software, or outputted to any desired format and resolution using the free Juicer software[^1^].
  
Each wipe and transition comes with a matching sound effect that perfectly complements the animation and adds energy to your scene change. The wipes and transitions are divided into two categories: full screen wipes and double alpha wipes.
  
### Full Screen Wipes
  
Full screen wipes cover up the entire screen at the point where the transition takes place. They are great for highlighting a shift in the focus of your production, such as changing the location, topic, or subject. For example, you can use a full screen wipe to switch from an interview to a b-roll footage, or from a product shot to a testimonial.
  
Some examples of full screen wipes in this collection are:

### Double Alpha Wipes
  
The double alpha wipes come in two pieces: an animated transitional matte and a coordinated animated overlay. The matte defines the shape of the wipe, while the overlay adds some visual flair to it. The double alpha wipes create a slick, transitional composite that doesn't require a full screen switch frame. They are ideal for adding some style and sophistication to your transitions, without being too flashy or distracting.

- Fold: A folding paper or a flipping book reveals the next scene on its other side.
- Gear: A rotating gear or a spinning wheel reveals the next scene through its holes.
- Glow: A glowing edge or a shining ring reveals the next scene inside it.
- Lens: A lens flare or a magnifying glass reveals the next scene through it.
- Puzzle: A puzzle piece or a jigsaw piece reveals the next scene behind it.
- Slide: A sliding bar or a moving stripe reveals the next scene along it.
- Splash: A splash of water or a drop of ink reveals the next scene behind it.
