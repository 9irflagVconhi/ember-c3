# The Design Of Everyday Things: A Book Review
 
The Design Of Everyday Things is a classic book by Don Norman that explores how design influences our interaction with objects and environments. The book was first published in 1988 and has been revised and updated several times since then. The latest edition was released in 2013 and includes new examples and insights from the digital age.
 
The book covers various aspects of design, such as affordances, signifiers, mappings, feedback, constraints, errors, and emotions. Norman argues that good design should make things easy to understand and use, while bad design can cause frustration, confusion, and even harm. He also provides practical guidelines and principles for improving design, as well as case studies and anecdotes from his own experience as a cognitive scientist and usability engineer.

In this section, we will review some of the key concepts and ideas from the book. We will also provide some examples and applications of these concepts in real-world scenarios.
 
## Affordances and Signifiers
 
Affordances are the possible actions or functions that an object or environment offers to a user. For example, a chair affords sitting, a door affords opening and closing, and a button affords pushing. Affordances are determined by the physical properties and capabilities of the object or environment, as well as the goals and needs of the user.
 
Signifiers are the cues or indicators that communicate the affordances to the user. For example, a handle on a door signifies that it can be pulled, a label on a button signifies what it does when pushed, and a red color on a switch signifies that it is dangerous or important. Signifiers can be intentional or unintentional, explicit or implicit, natural or artificial.

Good design should provide clear and consistent signifiers for the affordances of an object or environment. This helps the user to understand how to use it and what to expect from it. Bad design can create confusion or ambiguity by providing misleading or missing signifiers. For example, a door that has a handle on both sides but only opens one way can cause frustration and error for the user who tries to pull the wrong side.
 
## Mappings and Feedback
 
Mappings are the relationships between the controls and the effects of an object or environment. For example, a mapping between a switch and a light bulb determines which way to flip the switch to turn on or off the light. Mappings can be spatial, temporal, causal, or functional.
 
Feedback is the information that the object or environment provides to the user about the state or outcome of an action. For example, feedback from a light bulb is the illumination that indicates whether it is on or off. Feedback can be visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, or gustatory.
 
Good design should provide natural and intuitive mappings that match the expectations and mental models of the user. This helps the user to operate the object or environment with ease and confidence. Good design should also provide immediate and informative feedback that confirms or corrects the user's action. This helps the user to monitor and adjust their behavior accordingly. Bad design can create difficulty or error by providing unnatural or confusing mappings that require memorization or trial-and-error. Bad design can also create uncertainty or dissatisfaction by providing delayed or inadequate feedback that leaves the user wondering what happened or what to do next.
