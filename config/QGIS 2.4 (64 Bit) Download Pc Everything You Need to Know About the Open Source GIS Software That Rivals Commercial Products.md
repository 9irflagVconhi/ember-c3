## Analyze data
 
QGIS provides a variety of tools to analyze and process your spatial data. You can perform spatial analysis, network analysis, geostatistics, and more. QGIS currently offers vector analysis, raster analysis, sampling, geoprocessing, geometry and database management tools. You can also use the integrated GRASS tools, which include the complete GRASS functionality of more than 400 modules (see section [GRASS GIS Integration](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/user_manual/preamble/features.html#grass-gis-integration)). Additionally, you can extend the analysis capabilities of QGIS with the Processing framework, which provides access to hundreds of native and third-party algorithms (see section [Processing Framework](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/user_manual/processing/intro.html)).
  
## Publish maps on the Internet
 
QGIS allows you to share your maps and data on the web with QGIS Server. QGIS Server is an open source WMS 1.3 implementation that, in addition, implements advanced cartographic features for thematic mapping. QGIS Server provides a web map service (WMS) using the same libraries as the QGIS desktop application. Maps and print templates created in QGIS desktop can be published as web maps simply by copying the QGIS project file into the server directory. The web service permits the user to manipulate map content by using a web browser (see section [Working with OGC / ISO protocols](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_ogc/server/index.html)).

## Extend QGIS functionality through plugins
 
QGIS can be adapted to your special needs with the extensible plugin architecture and libraries that can be used to create plugins. You can browse and download many plugins from within QGIS by using the Plugin Manager tool (see section [Managing Plugins](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/user_manual/plugins/plugins.html)). You can also find plugins on the [QGIS Plugins website](https://plugins.qgis.org/). If you are interested in creating your own plugin, you can find a guide and API reference at [PyQGIS Developer Cookbook](https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/index.html).
