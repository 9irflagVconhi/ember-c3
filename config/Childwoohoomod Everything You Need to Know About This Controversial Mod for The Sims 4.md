## How to Use the Child Woohoo Mod?
 
To use the child woohoo mod, you need to have a child or teen sim who has a crush on another sim of the same age group. You can make them have a crush by using the "Confess Crush" interaction under the Friendly category. Once they have a crush, they can exchange phone numbers, hug, kiss on the cheek, hold hands, stargaze, goof around, propose to be partners, text, call, and grow together into teens.
 
If you have installed the v2.0 version of the mod, you can also make your teen sims woohoo with their partners. To do this, you need to have a bed or a tent on your lot. Then click on the bed or tent and choose the "Woohoo with..." option. You can also choose the "Try for Baby" option if you want your teen sims to get pregnant. However, be aware that there is a risk of pregnancy even if you choose the regular woohoo option.
 
If your teen sim gets pregnant, they will have a visible baby bump and go through trimesters like adult sims. They can also take a pregnancy test, announce their pregnancy, have mood swings, cravings, and morning sickness. If they do not want to keep the baby, they can choose to terminate the pregnancy by clicking on themselves and selecting the "Abortion" option under the Health category.

It allows children and teens to have romantic interactions with their crushes, including woohoo for teens. It also adds pregnancy and fertility features for teens, such as risky woohoo, menstrual cycle, and abortion.
