Now that you have downloaded Fundamentals of Metal Cutting and Machine Tools PDF for free, you might want to learn more about the topics covered in the book. Here are some of the main concepts and terms that you will encounter in the book:

1. **Machining Processes**: These are the methods of removing material from a workpiece to create a desired shape or surface. Some of the common machining processes are turning, milling, drilling, boring, shaping, planing, broaching, sawing, grinding, honing, lapping and polishing.
2. **Machine Tools**: These are the machines that perform the machining processes. They usually consist of a power source, a cutting tool, a workholding device and a mechanism for controlling the relative motion between the tool and the workpiece. Some of the common machine tools are lathe, milling machine, drilling machine, boring machine, shaping machine, planer, broaching machine, sawing machine and grinding machine.
3. **Metal Cutting Theory**: This is the branch of engineering that deals with the analysis and prediction of the mechanics and thermodynamics of metal cutting processes. It involves studying the forces, stresses, strains, temperatures, heat transfer, friction, wear and tool life involved in metal cutting.
4. **Cutting Tools**: These are the devices that remove material from the workpiece by shearing or abrasion. They usually have one or more cutting edges that are made of hard and wear-resistant materials such as high-speed steel, carbide, ceramic or diamond. Some of the common cutting tools are single-point tools, multipoint tools, form tools and abrasive tools.

These are just some of the topics that you will learn from Fundamentals of Metal Cutting and Machine Tools by Juneja and Sekhon. The book also covers other topics such as numerical control, computer-aided manufacture, non-conventional processes, surface finish and integrity, machining economics and design principles of cutting tools and jigs. The book is well-written and easy to understand with plenty of examples and illustrations. It is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn more about metal machining technology.
