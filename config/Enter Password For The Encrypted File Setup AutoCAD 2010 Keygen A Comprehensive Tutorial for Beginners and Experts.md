## Why do hackers and scammers use encrypted files?
 
One of the reasons why hackers and scammers use encrypted files is to evade detection by antivirus programs and security software. By encrypting the malicious code, they can hide it from the scanners and make it look like a legitimate file. Another reason is to trick users into thinking that they are downloading something valuable or exclusive, such as a keygen, a crack, or a leaked version of a software. By asking users to enter a password for the encrypted file, they can create a sense of urgency and curiosity, and persuade them to follow their instructions.
