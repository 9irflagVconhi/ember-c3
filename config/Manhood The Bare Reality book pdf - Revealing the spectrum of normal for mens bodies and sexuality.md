# Manhood: The Bare Reality - A Book Review
 
Manhood: The Bare Reality is a book by Laura Dodsworth that features 100 men who share their stories and reveal their penises in photographs. The book aims to explore the diversity of masculinity and challenge the stereotypes and taboos around male bodies and sexuality.
 
The book is divided into two parts: the stories and the methodology. The stories are arranged in alphabetical order by the men's first names, and each story is accompanied by a full-page portrait of the man's penis. The stories cover a wide range of topics, such as sexuality, circumcision, health, relationships, body image, trauma, pleasure, and identity. The men speak candidly and vulnerably about their experiences, feelings, and opinions, offering a glimpse into their inner worlds and personal journeys.

Manhood: The Bare Reality is a unique and powerful book that challenges the reader to question their own assumptions and prejudices about men and masculinity. It is also a celebration of human diversity and a tribute to the courage and honesty of the men who participated. The book is not only informative and insightful, but also inspiring and moving. It invites the reader to empathize with the men's stories, to appreciate their beauty and vulnerability, and to fall a little bit in love with them.
 
The book is available in PDF format online from various sources[^1^] [^2^] [^3^] [^4^], but it is recommended to buy a physical copy from Amazon or other retailers to support the author and her work.
  
The book has received positive reviews from critics and readers alike, who praised Dodsworth's courage, creativity, and sensitivity in tackling a taboo and controversial topic. Some reviewers noted that the book is not only a visual exploration of male anatomy, but also a psychological and sociological one, as it reveals how men relate to themselves, their partners, and their society. The book also challenges the stereotypes and expectations that are imposed on men by the media, the culture, and themselves, and invites them to embrace their diversity and authenticity.
 
Some of the themes that emerge from the book are the impact of circumcision, the effects of pornography, the pressure to perform sexually, the trauma of abuse or violence, the joy of fatherhood, the role of religion, the experience of ageing, and the meaning of identity. The book also showcases the stories of men who have undergone gender transition, who have lost or injured their penises, who have had surgery or implants, or who use prosthetic devices. The book celebrates the resilience and adaptability of men who have faced various challenges and changes in their lives.
 
Manhood: The Bare Reality is a book that can inspire and educate both men and women. It can help men to feel more comfortable and confident with their bodies, to express their emotions and needs more openly, and to connect with other men more deeply. It can also help women to understand men better, to appreciate their complexity and diversity, and to communicate with them more effectively. The book is a valuable resource for anyone who is interested in human sexuality, gender studies, psychology, sociology, or photography.
