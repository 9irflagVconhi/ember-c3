WIC reset key serial number is a code that you can buy online to activate the WIC reset utility, a software that can help you reset the waste ink counter of your Epson printer. The waste ink counter is a feature that tracks the amount of ink that is used for cleaning the print head and other maintenance tasks. When the counter reaches a certain limit, the printer will stop working to prevent ink overflow and damage.
  
To use WIC reset key serial number, you need to follow these steps:
  
1. Download the WIC reset utility from [https://www.wic.support/download/](https://www.wic.support/download/) and install it on your computer.
2. Connect your Epson printer to your computer with a USB cable and turn it on.
3. Run the WIC reset utility and select your printer model from the drop-down menu.
4. Click on "Read waste counters" button to check the current status of your waste ink counter. If it shows more than 100%, you need to reset it.
5. Click on "Buy now" button to purchase a WIC reset key serial number. You can pay by Visa, Master Card, PayPal, Webmoney or Western Union. You will receive an email with your WIC reset key serial number after payment.
6. Enter your WIC reset key serial number in the box and click on "OK" button.
7. Click on "Reset waste counters" button to start the resetting process. Wait for a few seconds until you see a message like "Waste counters have been reset successfully".
8. Turn off your printer and then turn it on again. Your printer should work normally now.

WIC reset key serial number is a one-time use code that can only reset one printer. If you have more than one printer that needs resetting, you need to buy more WIC reset keys. You can also use a trial reset key that can reset your waste ink counter to 80% one time only. You can get a trial reset key from [https://www.wic.support/trial-reset-key/](https://www.wic.support/trial-reset-key/).
